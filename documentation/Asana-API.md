This is the interface for interacting with the Asana platform. This reference is generated from our [OpenAPI Specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asana/openapi/master/defs/asana_oas.yaml), and contains a comprehensive reference for objects, schemas, and endpoints available in the API.

For contextual information, guides, and tutorials regarding API usage, visit our [guides](https://developers.asana.com/docs/overview).

To view the API reference for [app components](https://developers.asana.com/docs/overview-of-app-components), click [here](https://developers.asana.com/reference/ac-api-reference).

## [](https://developers.asana.com/reference/rest-api-reference#usage)

The Asana API is a [REST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST)ful interface with predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) or [form-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data) requests, returns JSON, and uses standard [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) features ([verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), [response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), etc.)

API endpoints are relative to the following [base URL](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/):

```
<span data-testid="SyntaxHighlighter">https://app.asana.com/api/1.0
</span>
```

Some requests return _compact_ representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. See [input/output options](https://developers.asana.com/docs/inputoutput-options) to customize your responses.

## [](https://developers.asana.com/reference/rest-api-reference#navigation)

-   Objects (i.e., resources in the API) are ordered alphabetically in the sidebar of this API reference
-   Object schemas can be found by selecting the object in the sidebar (e.g., [Attachments](https://developers.asana.com/reference/attachments))
-   Select an endpoint (e.g., [get a task](https://developers.asana.com/reference/gettask)) to see code samples, example requests, and responses

## [](https://developers.asana.com/reference/rest-api-reference#api-explorer)

Each API endpoint features a built-in, in-context [API explorer](https://developers.asana.com/docs/api-explorer) through which you can make requests (and see responses). For notes on enumerated values (i.e., on request properties), see [this documentation](https://developers.asana.com/docs/api-explorer#enumerated-values).
