Additional Notes

	•	AI Coding Assistance:
	•	Use Cursor for code generation and assistance.
	•	Utilize vo.dev for supplementary help when needed.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Follow the Vue.js style guide for consistency.
	•	Keep components modular and reusable.
	•	Ensure that sensitive data like API keys are not committed to GitHub.
	•	Development Approach:
	•	Tackle one module at a time.
	•	Verify functionality before moving to the next module.
	•	Integrate modules incrementally to build up the application.

By following these modular build stages, you can develop your prototype in manageable steps, ensuring that each part is functional before proceeding. This approach aligns with your goal of keeping the project simple and avoiding overcomplications, especially since you’re leveraging AI to assist with coding.
